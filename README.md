<h4>Retrospective and Next Steps</h4>
This project was built as my capstone project for a six-month full-stack web development program. We had two weeks to design and build a project that demonstrated what we had learned. This app was something that I personally wanted to have to track my own medical device wear and did concept validation with other chronic patients to confirm that I would be addressing a need in the community.



What I would do differently next time:
<ul>
  <li>If the concept is mobile, build it for mobile - I wavered on whether or not to use Ionic (not covered in class)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Next Steps:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Add feature to exported patient data OUT of the app for use and analysis with other applications by your or your doctor</li>
  <li>Straighten Up SQLite Tables to be more efficient</li>
  <li></li>
</ul>
